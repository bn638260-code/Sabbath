//! Detection accuracy benchmark: runs a labeled set of sermon-style utterances
//! through the live auto-live detection path (direct reference parsing + hybrid
//! FTS5 BM25 + vector search, mirroring the STT pipeline) and reports precision /
//! recall / accuracy at the auto-live confidence threshold.
//!
//! The dataset is authored and documented (not field-recorded), so the number
//! reflects a curated, diverse test set rather than live-service data. It is the
//! best defensible measurement available without a labeled sermon corpus.
//!
//! Usage (from repo root, so the default asset paths resolve):
//!   cargo run -p rhema-detection --features precompute-bin --release \
//!     --bin `detection_accuracy` -- [--threshold 0.90] \
//!     [--cases PATH] [--model PATH] [--tokenizer PATH] \
